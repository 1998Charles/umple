<h2>Umple runtime exception thrown when <a href="ImmutablePattern.html">Immutability</a> is violated in a constructor</h2>

<p>The immutable keyword in Umple can be applied to a class, an attribute or an association to ensure that they can only be set in the constructor, and cannot be modified again subsequently. If a constructor violates immutability, a RuntimeException is thrown. This can be caught by a try-catch block.</p>

<p>
In the example below different pathElements are required to have a Path. A runtime exception is thrown when an attempt is made to create a Path with duplicate pathElements.</p>
