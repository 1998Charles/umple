<p>      
An association defines a relationship from a <a href="ClassDefinition.html">class</a> to another class. More specifically, it defines which links (i.e. references or pointers) may exist at run time between instances of the classes.
</p>

<p>
Umple supports binary associations (associations with just two ends). This definition includes reflexive associations, in which both ends are the same class.
</p>

<p>
An association can specify the following information:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The classes involved (i.e. one or two classes)</li>
  <li>The restrictions on the number of objects allowed in the relationship (<a href="Multiplicity.html">multiplicity</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="RoleNames.html">Role names</a> on association ends (to clarify the relationship and avoid collision if two classes are associated in multiple ways</li>
</ul>

<p>
An association can be presented in four ways in Umple.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inline - Defined within one of the classes of the relationship</li>
  <li>Reflexive - A class that is associated with itself</li>
  <li>External - To associate a class to class in non-umple code.</li>
  <li>Association Class - A shorthand for two one-to-many associations to a class
  that contains data that relates the two classes. The two related classes are
  logically in a many-many relationship (this is currently under development).</li>
</ul>
