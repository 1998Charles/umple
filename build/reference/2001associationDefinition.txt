Association Definition
Associations

@@description
<p>      
An association defines a relationship from a class to a class. More specifically, it defines which links (i.e. references or pointers) may exist at run time between instances of the classes.
</p>

<p>
Umple supports binary associations (associations with just two ends). This definition includes reflexive associations, in which both ends are the same class.
</p>

<p>
An association can specify the following information:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The classes involved (i.e. one or two classes)</li>
  <li>The restrictions on the number of objects allowed in the relationship (multiplicity)</li>
  <li>Association end names (to clarify the relationship and avoid collision if two classes are
  associated in multiple ways</li>
</ul>

<p>
An association can be presented in four ways in Umple.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inline - Defined within one of the classes of the relationship</li>
  <li>Reflexive - A class that is associated with itself</li>
  <li>External - An external notation to associate two classes together</li>
  <li>Association Class - A special notation to define the two star "*" ends within an Association Class</li>
</ul>
