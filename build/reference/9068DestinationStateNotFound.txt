<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when the destination state of a transition cannot be found</h2>

<p>
The destination state of a transition should be defined in the state machine, otherwise the transition 
will be ignored. The warning is most likely caused by a typographical error.
<br/>
The warning can be resolved by correcting the destination state name or by creating the state.
