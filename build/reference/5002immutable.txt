@@description
<p>Mark a class as immutable to force all its contents to be immutable. The code ensures all attributes and associations can only be set in the constructor, and then cannot be set.</p>

<p>Individual attributes can be marked as immutable instead o the entire class; or they can be marked as <a href="LazyImmutableAttributes.html">lazy immutable</a> if they need to be initialized after the constructor has finished.</p>

<p>This feature is currently under development.</p>
