@@description
<p>If you want to avoid having an attribute change after it is initially
set, but do not want to have an argument in the constructor, then use the
combination of keywords 'lazy immutable'</p>

<p>You can call the set method just once on such an attribute. The set method
will return false if you try again. This is useful for interacting with
architectures where objects are constructed for you, so you have no ability
to specify constructor arguments.<p>
