@@description

<p>Constraints can be used to assert that certain properties of the model are as expected,
as shown in the examples below. Associations, attributes and generalizations can be checked.</p>

<p>Why would model constraints be useful, given that a programmer can just inspect the code to see if there are statements declaring the facts in question? The answer is that Umple has sophisticated separation of concerns mechanisms including <a href="Traits.html">traits</a>, mixins and <a href="BasicMixsets.html">mixsets</a>, and the developer may not be completely sure that a given model constraint will always be true. An attribute, for example, might be only introduced into the class in a completely different file or mixset, and the developer may not be certain that the file or mixset is being included. Using a model constraint allows a developer who wants to use that attribute in a method to cause an Umple compilation error if it does not in fact exist, rather than waiting to see if Java code fails to compile.
