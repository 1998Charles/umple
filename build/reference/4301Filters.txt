<p>Documentation of the filters feature is being developed</p>

<p>A filter directive in Umple can be used to select only a certain part of a model and ignore the rest. It is particularly designed to allow creation of different diagrams from the same model. However it could also be as a way of building a particular version of the system that only has certain features. It is one of Umple's separation of concerns mechanisms.</p>

<p>There are two types of filter statements, named and unnamed. An unnamed filter statement is active by default, and tells the system to include only certain indicated classes. A named filter statement is not active by default and can be used to describe a particular diagram (or system version). There can be any number of named filters.<p>

<p>Within a filter directive, one can specify:/p>

<ul>
  <li><i>include</i> statements. These list the main classes to be included. There can be any number if include statements, and multiple comma-separated classes can follow each include keyword.
  <li>Optionally <i>includeFilter</i> statements. These include other named filters. To activate a named filter, it is necessary to use an includeFilter statement in an unnamed filter.
  <li>Optionally <i>namespace</i> statements. These include all classes in the given namespace.  
  <li>Optionally <i>hops</i> statements. These indicate that additional classes should be included that are connected to included classes by associations or generalizations.
</ul>
