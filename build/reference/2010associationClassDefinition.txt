<p>      
An association class defines an object-oriented pattern to manage * to * (many to many) associations when data needs to be stored about each link of that association.
</p>

<p>An association class is a class and can have all the items found in a class. However it
always has two one-to-many associations to classes that otherwise would have had a many-to-many relationship.</p>

<p>Association classes in Umple are under development still. Some changes will
be forthcoming. At the current time, all attributes but one must have = followed by
a value to initialize them. Also Association classes are supposed to end up being like
two 1-* associations; currently in Umple they appear like two 0..1-* associations.</p>

<p>
Please note that an association class must define both star "*" ends; otherwise use a simple class instead.
</p>
