Association Class Definition
Associations

@@description
<p>      
An association class defines an object-oriented pattern to manage * to * (many to many) associations when data needs to be stored about each link of that association.
</p>

<p>An association class is a class and can have all the items found in a class. However it
always has two one-to-many associations to classes that otherwise would have had a many-to-many relationship.

<p>
Please note that an association class must define both star "*" ends; otherwise use a simple class instead.
