Associations

@@description
Describes the allowable number of entities that can participate in one end of an association.
In most cases you provide both a lower and upper bound, but the "many" (or "*") case assumes a zero
lower bound.

@@syntax
[=bound:*] | [lowerBound] .. [upperBound] | [bound]

@@example
// There can be any number of links from an instance at the other end
// of the association to instances at this end 
//
// The lower bound is zero and the upper bound is 'many'
