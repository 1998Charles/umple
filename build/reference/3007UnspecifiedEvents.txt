@@description
<p>
In Umple, &#39;unspecified&#39; events can be used to handle events that have no handlers in
the current state (and would normally be ignored) in a queued or regular state machine. If the 
event is used in a pooled state machine, it will simply be ignored and treated as a regular event.
The event can be placed at any level of nesting. </br>

If the occurence of a non-handled event may cause a problem in a state machine, unspecified 
events can be used to transition to error states.
