<p>
A history state is used to keep the last state of a state machine in memory, in order to access
it again when needed.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of history states: Deep history states and regular history states. The former 
stores the specific substate the state machine was previously in, while the latter will restart from
the general state it was called to.
</p>
<p>
History states are called using dot notation, by referring to the state to go back to, and using
either the symbol H for regular history states or HStar for deep history states.
