@@description
The Umple language allows a developer to extend the functionality of a class with arbitrary
methods written the natively compiled language (e.g. Java or Php).  Within these arbitrary
methods, a developer may call methods that access the Umple attributes, associations and state machines; helping
to unify the programmer interface, and simplify the resulting code.
