<p><b>Transition actions:</b>      
When n transition is taken, an action can occur. This is indicated
using a slash "/" followed by arbitrary code in braces. The arbitrary code
may be placed after the event name or before the destination state name. In other words the arrow -&gt; can be placed either directly after the event (before the action), or directly before the destination state (after the action)

<p><b>Entry and exit actions:</b>
Similarly,
when entering or exiting a state, an action can occur. This is indicated
using the keywords entry or exit, followed by a slash, followed by code.
</p>

<p>The actions described above should be programmed such that they take negligible time to execute; in other words they shouldn't contain significant loops..</p>

<p><b>Do activities:</b>
If a longer-running computation (activity) needs to be while in a state,
encode this using the keyword do, followed by a block of code
in curly brackets. In languages such as Java
that support it, a thread will be started
to invoke the code. This allows the state machine to 'stay live'
and be able to respond to other events, even while the do activity is
running. A do activity thread can be
interrupted and cancelled when a transition is taken out of the state. To enable this
in Java, the code it needs to catch InterruptedException as shown in the first example.</p>
