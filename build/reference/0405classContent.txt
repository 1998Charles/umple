A class can contain any of the following items. Interfaces are limited to those marked [Interfaces]:

<ul>

<li>Comments describe the intent of your class [Interfaces too]]</li>

<li>isA directives that specify a superclass to your class (i.e. a Supervisor could be descrbied as "isA Person") [Interfaces can have more than one]</li>

<li>Attribute describing simple data that can be found in any element of the class (i.e. name, dob, amount)</li>

<li>A singleton declaration that limits the system to only one instance of this class (e.g. there may only be one Bank in a banking system)</li>

<li>Depends clauses that describe external dependencies that might be used by your class within methods</li>

<li>Associations that define links to instances of other classes (or to other instances of this class). </li>

<li>Internal class definitions that define subclass of this class</li>

<li>Methods that provide behaviour for the class [Interfaces can have declarations of methods only]</li>

<li>State machine definitions that describe declaratively attributes that change value in certain behaviour patterns in response to actions such as method calls.
