This directory is intended to contain code for projects that use Umple but are not
part of the Umple project itself.

We invite people to create their own umple exaples, including proper test cases. 
These test cases can be built automatically, and helping us ensure that updates to 
the compiler donâ€™t break your code. They also serves as additional test cases for us.
